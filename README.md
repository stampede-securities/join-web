# DEV React-Apollo Starter App

A repository with starter code for new frontend web projects at DEV

## Starting a New Project

**NOTE: Delete this section in the README once you have started the new project**

Run these commands to start a new project built off of this repository.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hsadev/react-frontend-starter.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> && cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> # clone repo 
$ rm -rf .git # delete original git history
$ git init # create new git repository
$ git remote add origin <YOUR_PROJECT_GIT_REPOSITORY> # add remote for github repo
```

## Project Structure
The repo was built by the general frontend web file structure conventions we user at DEV.  It has react-router and apollo-client set up in src/App.js.  It has a full devloper environment with prettier/eslint/travis set up.

This repository was designed first and foremost to **scale** to large projects.  It should be easy to extend the base file structure and setup here to much larger projects.

## Set up
```bash
$ npm i
```
## Running
```bash
$ npm start
```
